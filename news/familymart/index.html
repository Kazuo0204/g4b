            <p>Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia -12th November 2020- In the expansion of the eGift Platform(※1) Business GIFTEE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD., a Malaysian subsidiary company of giftee, Inc is pleased to announce the successful implementation of an eGift sales system for businesses, “eGift System” (※2) for QL Maxincome Sdn. Bhd., the master franchisee of convenience store “FamilyMart Malaysia” (hereafter referred to as FamilyMart). Starting from September 2020, the eGift services are now available in more than 200 FamilyMart stores nationwide in Malaysia, with the launching of eGifts targetted at corporate customers.</p>
            <p>The corporate vision of giftee, Inc is “To provide services that nurture the ties between people, businesses and townships, through eGifts”. Based on this mission, the company provides an end-to-end eGift platform solution from the issuance of eGifts to distribution, developing the business within and beyond Japan.There are 4 main services, namely “giftee”(※3), a casual gift service; “eGift System”, a system that generates and sells eGifts and tickets; “giftee for Business”(※4), a business-to-business eGift service; and “Welcome ! STAMP”, a platform for area revitalization. These eGift services provide extensive coverage to the individual customer, corporation and municipal council. Additionally, the eGift business expanded into the ASEAN region with the incorporation of GIFTEE MALAYSIA in October 2018, and has implemented the “eGift System” to 11 brands in Malaysia as of June 2020.</p>
            <p>The “eGift System” implemented in QL Maxincome Sdn. Bhd. allows eGifts that are kind of E-Vouchers created by “eGift System” to be issued and redeemed instantly. There are 4 types of FamilyMart eGifts issued from the “eGift System”, namely RM10 and RM20 cash vouchers, Oden voucher worth RM10 and Soft serve ice cream voucher. These 4 types of FamilyMart eGift vouchers would be available for purchase via giftee Malaysia under the “giftee for Business” solution that handles B-to-C sales and distribution operation, where corporate customers could purchase for use as incentives in their own corporate digital campaign. “giftee for Business” is a service that provides eGifts that can be utilised in corporate promotional campaigns for example, as a thank-you token for participation in surveys, promotional campaigns on SNS, points-redeemable gift, or a reward campaign to promote visits to the store. This service was launched in 2016 in Japan, and a total of 495 companies have come on board as per Apr ~ June 2020 figures.</p>
            <p>The eGift recipient who receives the eGift as an incentive, can redeem the eGift at the store by showing the eGift receipt screen on the smartphone. The store completes the payment process by scanning the eGift screen using its POS System or giftee STAMP(※5) system.
Each eGift has its own unique URL, which enables the instant collection of data, such as date and time of the visit to the store, the visited store, the type of eGift, and whether or not other purchases are made at the same time, as soon as the payment is processed. This information can then be used to conduct quantitative analysis of eGift usage, as a useful CRM tool. Also, unlike paper-based tickets and coupons, the eGift is redeemed the instant it is processed with the system, changing the status of the eGift to “Redeemed”, hence preventing unauthorized use of e-tickets.</p>
            <p>giftee Inc. and GIFTEE MALAYSIA shall cotinue to introduce “eGift System” to Malaysian brands and promote eGifting as well as distributing to F&B brands. We hope to generate more demand for corporate customers in line with the C-to-C market development and work towards increasing the eGift distribution volume and building more awareness of eGift.We aim to create a culture and custom of casual gifting by sending eGifts with ease, as a means to convey our day-to-day wishes to each other.</p>
            <p>(※1)　eGift Plaftform provides end-to-end service from eGift issuance to distribution.<br>(※2)　eGift System is a gift sales system provided by giftee, Inc. to businesses.
