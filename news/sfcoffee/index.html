          <div class="detail">
            <p>Kuala Lumpur,Malaysia -23 June 2020- giftee,Inc & GIFTEE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD. are pleased to announce the successful implementation of “eGift System”(*1), a sales system for eGifts, for the San Francisco Coffee (SF Coffee) brand F&B outlets, operated by SAN FRANCISCO COFFEE SDN. BHD. (Headquarters:Malaysia / Executive Director: Dato’ Kamal Y P Tan). From 10 June 2020, the eGift service has been available in over 50 SF Coffee outlets in Malaysia. With the inclusion of Secret Recipe, the total number of eGift brands available in Malaysia has reached 11 brands.</p>
            <p>The corporate mission of giftee, Inc is “Using gifts to connect people & people, people & business, and people & communities”. Based on this mission, the company provides an end-to-end eGift platform solution from the issuance of eGifts to distribution, developing the business within and beyond Japan.</p>
            <p>There are 4 main services, namely “giftee”(*2), a casual gift service; “eGift System”, a system that generates and sells eGifts and tickets; “giftee for Business”(*3), a business-to-business eGift service; and “Welcome ! STAMP”, a platform for area revitalization. These eGift services provide extensive coverage to the individual customer, corporation and municipal council. Additionally, in October 2018, giftee, Inc. established GIFTEE MALAYSIA, a Malaysian subsidiary company, and started to expand its eGift business to ASEAN countries.</p>
            <p>The “eGift System”　implemented in SAN FRANCISCO COFFEE SDN. BHD. allows eGifts to be issued and redeemed instantly. eGifts can be purchased from the online sales webpage of the brand’s website and payment via credit card, online banking or even e-wallet are available. Upon payment, a URL for the eGift is issued. The purchaser can then immediately send the issued eGift attached with a digital message card to a friend or family member via SMS, Whatsapp or other similar apps. The eGift recipient can redeem the eGift for the item at a participating store by showing the eGift receipt screen on their smartphone. The store completes the payment process by scanning the eGift screen using its POS System or giftee STAMP(*4) system.</p>
            <p>Each eGift has its own unique URL, which enables the instant collection of data, such as date and time of the visit to the store, the visited store, the type of eGift, and whether or not other purchases are made at the same time, as soon as the payment is processed. This information can then be used to conduct quantitative analysis of eGift usage, as a useful CRM tool. Also, unlike paper-based tickets and coupons, the eGift is redeemed the instant it is processed with the POS system or giftee STAMP system, changing the status of the eGift to “Redeemed”, hence preventing unauthorized use of e-tickets.</p>
            <p>Other than the sales of eGifts in the C-to-C market space for SF Coffee, it is also possible to run corporate digital campaigns in the form of incentive programs through GIFTEE MALAYSIA, in the B-to-C space of sales and distribution.</p>
            <p>giftee and GIFTEE MALAYSIA shall continue to introduce “eGift System” to Malaysian brands and promote eGifting as well as distributing to F&B brands. We hope to generate more demand for corporate customers in line with the C-to-C market development and work towards increasing the eGift distribution volume and building more awareness of eGift.
We aim to create a culture and custom of casual gifting by sending eGifts with ease, as a means to convey our day-to-day wishes to each other.</p>
            <p>(*1) eGift Plaftform provides end-to-end service from eGift issuance to distribution.<br>
              (*2) giftee is a web-based/application service for the sale of eGifts, operated by giftee, Inc.<br>
              (*3) giftee for Business enables companies to send eGifts to customers, for example as campaign gifts or as a reward for completing a survey.<br>
              (*4) eGift System is a gift sales system provided by giftee, Inc. to businesses. Businesses that implement the system can use it to operate eGift services on their own websites.</p>
