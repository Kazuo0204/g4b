            <p>Kuala Lumpur, 11th June 2019: eGift service(*1) provider giftee, Inc of Japan, today scored another success in Malaysia with Big Apple Donuts & Coffee, a donut brand operated by Big Apple Worldwide Holdings Sdn. Bhd. joining its eGift System(*2)Giftee Malaysia Sdn Bhd, a local subsidiary of giftee, Inc whose headquarters is in Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, said in a statement that this was the second top local brand to utilise e-Gifts in Malaysia.</p>
            <p>giftee, Inc. has the corporate mission of “Using gifts to connect people to people, people to business, and people to communities.” Based on this mission, it provides “giftee”(*3), a casual gift service that allows customers to send gifts online easily, along with the sentiment of “a little thank you” for everyday kindnesses. It also operates a SaaS business providing the “eGift System,” an eGift sales system for businesses. Launching “giftee for Business,” a new solution for businesses based on its original “giftee” service, in April 2016, and “Welcome!STAMP,” a local e-currency system, in May 2016, the company has used the technologies it has built up in its eGift business to actively develop new businesses. Additionally, in October 2018, giftee, Inc. established GIFTEE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD., a Malaysian local subsidiary, and started to expand its eGift business in ASEAN countries.</p>
            <p>The eGift System to be introduced at Big Apple Donuts & Coffee is a system in which eGifts can be issued and reconciled instantly. eGifts may be purchased from the sale page of the individual brand’s website, at which point the purchased eGift will be issued. The purchaser can then immediately send the issued eGift to a friend or family member via SMS, Whatsapp, or other similar apps. The eGift recipient can redeem the eGift for a product at a participating store by showing the eGift receipt screen on their smartphone. The store completes the payment process by using its PoS system or the giftee Stamp(*4) to read the eGift screen. All participating Big Apple Donuts & Coffee stores have been equipped with the giftee Stamp. Each eGift has its own unique URL, which enables the instant collection of data, such as the date and time of the visit to the store, the store visited, the type of eGift, and whether or not other items were sold at the same time, as soon as the payment is processed. Because this information can then be used to conduct quantitative analysis of eGift usage information, this makes the system useful as a CRM tool. Also, unlike paper-based tickets and coupons, the eGift is “reconciled” the instant that it is processed with the giftee Stamp, changing the status of the eGift to “Redeemed” so the re-use of eGift can be prevented.</p>
            <p>Big Apple Donuts & Coffee, operated by Big Apple Worldwide Holdings Sdn. Bhd. is one of that country’s largest donut retail chains. With its concept of “Every Piece is a Master Piece,” it is popular with all ages. Big Apple Donuts & Coffee Gifts, which will be available from the Big Apple eGift website (https://bigapple.store.egift.asia/) that launches on June 11, 2019, are eGifts that can be used when paying at Big Apple Donuts & Coffee outlets in Malaysia. Purchasers can choose from credit card or online banking to pay for the eGifts.There are three types of Big Apple Donuts & Coffee eGifts available: “RM5 Cash Voucher”, “RM10 Cash Voucher “ and “RM20 Cash Voucher”. These eGifts are redeemable at all Big Apple Donuts & Coffee outlets in Malaysia.</p>
            <p>giftee, Inc. & GIFTEE MALAYSIA SDN. BHD., are working to further the popularisation of its eGift System in ASEAN countries, with a focus on Malaysia, and plans to extend the system to approximately 10 brands in Malaysia during 2019. Overseas rollout of “giftee for Business”, a B2C-oriented corporate solution, is also progressing in the same manner, and through the popularisation of eGifts both nationally and internationally, we aim to create a custom and culture of casual gift-giving where people can casually express their personalised greeting accompanied by a gift.</p>
            <p>(*1) A service in which the gift-giver purchases a digital gift ticket online and sends it to the recipient, who can exchange it for goods in-store.<br>
              (*2) eGift System is a gift sales system provided by giftee, Inc. to businesses. Businesses that implement the system can use it to operate eGift services on their own websites.<br>
              (*3) giftee is a web-based service for the sale of eGifts, operated by giftee, Inc.<br>
              (*4) giftee STAMP, launched by giftee, Inc. on November 27, 2015, is a highly secure, batteryless electronic stamp. Simply by touching the electronic stamp to the screen of the smartphone or other mobile devices, the electronic stamp can be checked against individual eGifts and be processed as spent.</p>
